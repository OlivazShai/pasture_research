# Preparing data

This is a very memory-intensive process. The data is divided in large tiles of satellite imagery. In a shape-file, I have data on the tiles location. First, I select data on the tiles in Brazil, and save the links to the API with pixel level data on each tile.

I wrote two functions to perform this data cleaning process. First, I download in parallel each tile and save the raster in the hard drive. Then, I use the exact_extract algorithm to get zonal sum by AMC, from each tile. This zonal statistic calculation is applied each of the 17 tiles in the Brazilian territory. Finally, I aggregated all the 17 zonal statistics by AMC, resulting in the sum of carbon biomass in each zone.

## Open shapefile

First, I open the metadata on the tiles, saved in a shapefile, which contains the location and the API link to download the raster.

```{r}
c_meta <- st_read(
  "../Inputs/carbon_biomass/Aboveground_Live_Woody_Biomass_Density.shp"
  ) 

# Reproject the dataframe
# Use the same CRS as Brazil (SIRGAS 2000) 

c_meta <- st_transform(
  c_meta,
  st_crs(brazil)
  )
```

## Subset region

Then, I intersect with the shape of the Brazilian territory. In sequence, I extract the links to the API with pixel level data on each tile.

```{r}
c_meta_br <- st_intersection(
  c_meta,
  brazil
)

links <- setNames(
  # save links as list
  as.list(c_meta_br$Mg_px_1_do), 
  # take id as names
  c_meta_br$tile_id
  )
```

## Align AMC CRS to raster's

Here, I set the CRS of my AMC polygons to the same of the carbon biomass rasters (WGS 84).

```{r}
amc_84 <- st_transform(
  amc_1991_2022,
  crs = "EPSG:4326"
  ) |> 
  select(-area_amc)
```

# Download and save the rasters

Downloads every tile in parallel and saves in drive.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
download_biomass(
  api_links = links,
  folder_path = "../Biomass"
  )
```

# Zonal statistics

Now I calculate the zonal sum by AMC.

```{r}
biomass <- process_biomass(
  zones = amc_84,
  folder_path = "../Biomass"
  )
```

# Export as RDS

```{r}
bulk_write_rds(biomass)
```
